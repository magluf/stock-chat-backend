## Utility scripts

### `prod-env.ts`: Production environment generator script:

- Compiles the project's files and outputs the resulting JavaScript files in a folder at root (by default, it will output them to `./dist`);
- Outputs a `packlage.json` file based on the root `package.json` file, excluding all scripts except `prod` and `devDependencies`;
- Outputs a `Procfile` with `web: npm run prod` as its contents.

### `git-submodules.ts`: Git submodule for production generator script:

- Checks for uncommited chages in current tree;
- Generates production files with `prod-end.ts`;
- Add the generated production files to a submodule `production` at the root directory and pushes changes to origin.
